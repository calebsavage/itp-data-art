He still likes reading it all the time.","when i was 15 years old i got pregnant and my mom knew right away.she kept me that i was pregnant because i was eating alot,but i didn't know that i was pregnant.and my mom told me that if i was pregnant that she would kill me,but when i went to the doctor she went with me and i found out that i was 2 months pregnant and my moms eyes got so big.when the doctor said that i was pregnant she was so happy that she forgot about being mad.My dad didn't talk to me for 16 years but he starting taling to me when i got pregnant after all she was his first grandchild.","when i was 15 years old i got pregnant and my mom knew right away.she kept me that i was pregnant because i was eating alot,but i didn't know that i was pregnant.and my mom told me that if i was pregnant that she would kill me,but when i went to the doctor she went with me and i found out that i was 2 months pregnant and my moms eyes got so big.when the doctor said that i was pregnant she was so happy that she forgot about being mad.My dad didn't talk to me for 16 years but he starting taling to me when i got pregnant after all she was his first grandchild.","With a nice card from Hallmark.","Up-front and honestly is my best advice.","Quick and to the point.

Our son didn't start sleeping through the night until about 22 months!\n\nBetter answer:  Stuff 'im to the gills!  Babies mostly wake because of hunger.  Fat babies start sleeping throught the night earlier than thin ones.  (A friend's daughter slept thru at only 6 weeks--she had three (3) fat rolls just on her upper arms!)  Usually babies won't start sleeping thru until they start on solids, which take longer to digest.  Beware of starting solids too early as this can increase the risk of diabetes.  Check with your pediatrician.","My 4mo baby girl sleeps through the night (almost) and the trick is giving her a nice warm bath; talk\/play with her while dressing her up for 15-20 mins.

Works wonders for our guy. If he's not tired then try a bath, singing soothing songs, dimming the lights, etc. Different babies have different sleep patterns, does your guy *need* a nap during the day or is he happy going 'til night time?","he may not need to sleep during the day my first only used to nap for about 20 mins a time during the day but my last 2 are good day time sleepers i found if i relaxed the children would relax but please learn to put him down once comforted if he falls asleep on you put him in his cot not on the sofa or your bed even if its just for 10 mins then he knows cot is bed is sleep good luck be strong its hard work but you get there in the end","The way my son overcame that stage was with a bath and good meal, then I wrapped him in one of my favorite shirts that I had worn but not yet washed, so that all night he would smell my scent.","It seems as though you have a few parts to the problem here.  Firstly, does your son cry during day when not being held, or only at night when you're wanting to put him to sleep?\n\nThere could be reasons as to why he prefers being held - comfort, warmth, smell, habit...\n\nMy daughter doesn't sleep very much during the day.  I wake her for her first feed at around 6:30am.  The back to bed for another few hours.  Next feed between 9:30-11 depending on how tired she is and how much she's had at the previous feed.  From there on in, she pretty much doesn't sleep for the rest of the day.  Maybe a cat nap here or there in the car?  Depending on how much or little sleep she's had, when her last feed was, and how tired she is, Aaliyah is put to bed anwhere between 7 - 8:30pm and sleeps through the night until we wake her for her first feed.  She is exclusively breast fed, is happy fat and rolypoly and is now 7 and a half months old so don't let anyone tell you it's not possible for a baby to last more than a few hours on breast milk.\n\nWe found that making sure she was tired was a sure fire way of making sure she'd sleep.  Sometimes babies aren't sleepy enough when we want to put them to bed and kick up a bit of a fuss 'cuase they don't like being alone.\n\nThis may be solved by providing them with a 'friend' or favourite toy, or a shirt you've worn that smells like you when you put them into their cot.\n\nYou might just find that your son's particular pattern includes not sleeping so much at day, but longer at night.  And that's okay.  Whatever suits him is fine.\n\nHope this has helped.","The best solution is to try as many different suggestions and find one that works for you. The one thing that helped my son was getting him a pacifier that he liked.  He did not like all those orthodontic pacifiers that they sell.  He likes the Gerber Gentle Flex pacifier, and won't take anything else.  Unfortunately I didn't find this until he was 5 months old, I just thought he didn't like pacifiers.  Its a lot easier to make him sleep now.  And he sleeps all through the night, he cries in during the night, but i just put the pacifier back in his mouth and he is good to go.","Mrs. Chicken is right!\n\nYou can also hide it in there favorite foods without them knowing.

Stimulation can be in the form of massage, breastfeeding, or pumping using a hospital grade type pump.  Domperidone is a medication that some use to increase supply.  Certain herbs can also be supplimented to increase supply including fenugreek (the most popular one), blessed thistle, and red raspberry leaf.  Fenugreek does have a side effect of making you smell like maple.","There are a couple main factors that seem to contribute to your milk supply:\n1 - frequency of feedings (when your child goes through growth spurts - she will naturally increase your milk supply by needing to eat more frequently)\n2 - mother is eatting a sufficient number of calories (i've known mom's who have taken to aggressive of a diet trying to lose baby weight lose their supply of milk.  breastfeeding burns approximately 400 calories a day so the mom's caloric intake is definitely a factor)\n3 - staying sufficiently hydrated - your milk supply will also depend on how much water\/liquids you drink.  i've noticed a direct correlation of how much i've drank and my milk supply.\n\nyour body sometimes will go through natural weaning stages where your milk somewhat decreases for a couple days.  to counteract that the above 3 factors should be tried first.  if this does not help - you can try taking fenugreek (natural herbal supplement found in places like whole foods).  this works well for some mothers, but not for all.\n\ngood luck!  it's definitely a worthwhile endeavor.","You can also increase supply by using a breast pump after feedings. Supply will be highest in the early morning hours (4 am), and lower late in the day. \n\nDrink TONS of water.","I wholeheartedly agree with everything that Catherine_b has said.\n\nAs Dr Sears says, there are three B's to breastfeeding: the Breast, the Baby and the Brain.  To increase your milk supply, the breast needs more stimulation from the baby and making that happen will require some adjustments in your brain. To increase your milk supply, you have to make breastfeeding a priority.  Easily said, but like anything it only takes practise.\n\nDon't rush feed times.  Enjoy them.  If you can, find a quiet nook you can cozy up with your baby - a space that eventually feels almost 'sacred' to the two of you.  You will both look forward to feed times and the more you do, the more your baby will feed, and the more milk you will make.\n\nThink baby, think milk. While you are feeding, stroke and calm your baby using a lot of skin-to-skin contact - a practice called grooming. Enjoy his sweet face and the feel of his skin. This will help your milk ejection reflex. The milk ejection reflex squeezes the milk you make out of the milk glands and down into the ducts and milk sinuses where it's available to the baby. Between breastfeedings and immediately before a feeding, imagine your infant nursing at your breast and your breasts pouring out milk to satisfy your baby.\n\nI particularly found this a useful technique!\n\nI would also like to add that there are a number of herbs you can take (in tea or capsule form) which will increase your milk quality and supply, the most populare of which are listed below:\n * Fennel\n * Fenugreek seeds\n * Red Raspberry Leaf\n * Chamomile (which acts doubly to help calm your baby as the active constituents pass through the milk into your baby.  I found this to work a treat in helping my little one settle when colicky!)\n\nAnd, just as important as it is to add things or make sure you get enough of certain things (sleep, nutrition, liquid intake, herbal supplementation) it is also just as important to avoide certain things which may 'dry up' your milk supply.\n\nFor example, stressful situations.  Dieting.  Prolonged strenuous\/physical exercise or work.\n\nYou might also find that 'supplementing' your child's breast milk supply with bottle-fed formula actually achieves the result of your child needing\/wanting less breast which only in turn causes your supply to diminish.\n\nOther information on heral galactagogues can be found here: http:\/\/www.kellymom.com\/herbal\/milksupply\/herbal-rem_c.html\n\nThe Australian Breastfeeding Association also has a great section, including pharmacological galactagogues.

It is a type of the future event of the church being joined with the Messiah, Yeshua. Why does God hate divorce? Because it breaks the type--for Yeshua will NEVER leave us. So, how do you deal with such a heartache? Use it as a springboard to launch yourself into a new relationship with your Lord. Read and meditate on Psalm 126 and see if my study below helps with you in this new direction. And I will pray for my sister Sad.","Dear lady my heart hurts for you. I've been divorced 3 times so I'm no stranger to the kind of pain your going through. This is a very tough question and I'm not altogether sure if I have the answer, but I hope I can be of some help. First of all I want to assure you that you are right to value the sanctity of marriage. \"Have Bible\" is right, marriage is a \"type\" or symbol of Jesus Christ's relationship with his bride the Church. It is a most beautiful picture in the physical realm of a higher spiritual truth. I think that if you are both willing to try to salvage this marriage, it is certainly worth saving. If this is the case, then the girlfriend has to go, like yesterday. Your marriage has no room for a third wheel. Then if he agrees to try to save the marriage and cut loose the girlfriend, I suggest that the two of you immediately seek the guidance of a godly marriage counselor. If, on the other hand, he wants to leave, let him leave. The Apostle Paul says that a child of God is not bound to a spouse who abandons them. Dear sister, I'm afraid this is the best I can do.

The below can all be arranged to fit your particular needs.  Again these are only some basic suggestions.\n\nFlorence.  You can fly into Florence via several European cities.  I find the flight from Munich on Lufthansa very accommodating.\n\nI can also recommend a number of hotels, starting at 3* with Caravaggio (link below).  If you want something a little higher end, you might try the Tornabuoni.  \n\nYou of course, would want to visit the Galleria dell' Accademia (where Michelangelo's David is).  However, if you like history and archaeology, I highly recommend the Tuscan Archaeological Museum that is just around the corner.  For the Galleria, you definitely want reservations.  You can get these through any number of sites, but I prefer to contact the Museum directly.  (See link below; the sight also has information on a number of other museums including the Uffizi Gallery, Boboli Gardens and Bargello Museum&mdash;where Donatello&rsquo;s David is.)  For the Archaeology museum you most likely do not need a reservation, but for the last three I just mentioned, I would highly recommend it.\n\nOf course, you will want to visit the Cathedral (Il Duomo).  The baptistery and bell tower are interesting too (both have separate admissions).  I would also recommend a visit to Santa Croce and Santa Maria Novella.  There are also some others of interest including San Lorenzo.  I would also visit the small refectory of Santa Reparata to see an otherwise not-so-well-known &lsquo;Last Supper&rsquo;.  \n\nThere is also the market of San Lorenzo that sells tons of leather works and local crafts.

The first two are easily accessible by train, but you might consider renting a car (easy to do, and there are several rental agencies located near the main train station in Florence).\n\nIf you feel like having a bit of hike and a beautiful view then I would recommend visiting Cinque Terre.  There are a number of ways to visit the cities, but I would do one of the following.  \n\nStaying at in La Spezia (train from Florence will put you right near the hotel) and then either taking the bus or the train to the most northerly of the cities (Monterosso).  Walk to a couple of the cities and then catch the train back to La Spezia.  Or stay in Monterosso and the next morning (early) set off to see all the Cinque Terre and then take the train back from (Riomaggiore).

Air stores and returns energy relatively efficiently during a rapid bounce, so the pressurized ball bounces high. But an underinflated ball dents deeply and its skin flexes inefficiently. Much of the ball's original energy is wasted in heating the bending skin and it doesn't bounce very high. In general, the higher the internal pressure in the ball, the better it will bounce. However, the ball doesn't bounce all by itself when you drop it on a flexible surface. In that case, the surface also dents and is responsible for part of the ball's rebound. If that surface handles energy inefficiently, it may weaken the ball's bounce. For example, if you drop the ball on carpeting, the carpeting will do much of the denting, will receive much of the ball's original energy, and will waste its share as heat. The ball won't rebound well.","The more pressure a ball has inside it, the less its surface dents during a bounce and the more of its original energy it stores in the compressed air.

You imagine the thrill of lining up the winning symbols and dream about how you will spend all that money.  Then reality kicks in and deep down you know that you have a better chance of getting struck by lighting than you do hitting the big jackpot. Does this mean you should not play Progressive slot machines?\n\nWhile the odds of hitting a life changing jackpot may be astronomical, you don\u2019t have to avoid all progressive machines. As long as you know what to expect and have some realistic expectations you can give them a shot. There are also some progressive machines that are better than others if you want to hit the jackpot. First let\u2019s take a look at the basic of progressive machines.\n\nThe big progressive jackpot is made by taking a percentage of all the money played into the machine. This means that the jackpot continues to grow as more people play the machine until somebody hits the winning symbols for the top award. Because a percentage of the coins played form the Progressive Jackpot, the actual payback percentage will be less on the other winning symbols and in some case the payback percentage on the Progressive machines will be less than other machines in the casino. This is true for the machines that offer the life changing jackpots. Not all progressive machines are the same. There are actually three different types of progressive machines.\n\n The Stand Alone Progressive\n\nThe stand alone progressive machine is not linked to any other machines. Instead of having a fixed top jackpot it takes a percentage of the coins played and adds that to the award for the highest winning combination .It has a meter on the front and shows you the jackpot. In most cases the payback is equal to the other machines of that denomination but it just distributed differently to give you a varying amount for the top prize. The progressive jackpots for the stand alone machines is much lower that the ones from machines that are linked together.\n\n In-House or Proprietary Progressives\n\nThese are a group of machines linked together and owned and operated by the casino. They may be just in a single casino or linked together with several properties if the gaming company owns more than one casino. The jackpots may not be the multi-million variety but they can be quite a substantial win in some casinos. They generally hit more often that the big wide area Progressives. \n\nWide Area Progressive.\n\nThese are the machines that offer the life changing jackpots. The machines are linked together from many unrelated casinos. These machines are operated by an independent operated rather than a single gaming company. Slot maker IGT operates games such as MegaBucks, Quatermania, and others in many different States. The casino share in a percentage of the winnings but the operator owns the games. The Jackpots may be large but so are your chances of hitting the big prize. Because of the costs of linking the machine and the administrative costs to run these Area wide games, the payback percentage on these machines is much lower than on other slots.\n\nIt\u2019s alright to try your hand at the big progressive machines hoping that lady luck will shine on you but don\u2019t make it the mainstay of your slot play. Instead set aside a certain percentage of your playing bankroll and use that for a shot at the big one. Winning one of these is pure luck and is a gamble along the lines of buying a lottery ticket. Don\u2019t spend your entire bankroll chasing dream. If you want to play a progressive machine you might be better off to concentrate your efforts on the Stand Alones or In House Progressives. Your odds are much better. Most importantly remember, playing slots is entertainment. Have Fun!","More than Bernoulli's principle and wing shape (airfoil) are at work in keeping a plane in the air. The main criteria is the  &quot;angle of attack&quot; of the wing. That is, the angle at which the wing meets the air passing by it. When a plane is flying, its wing is always at a positive angle of attack; the leading edge of the wing is higher relative to the air going over it than the trailing edge. So the air pushes the wing up.  When the plane is inverted, the angle of attack must be great enough to overcome the &quot;negative lift&quot;  created by the airfoil.

Six lists of names are prepared in advance, and each list is used once every six years. Five letters \u2014 \"Q,\" \"U,\" \"X,\" \"Y\" and \"Z\" \u2014 are omitted in the Atlantic; only \"Q\" and \"U\" are omitted in the Eastern Pacific, so the format accommodates 21 or 24 named storms in a hurricane season. Names of storms may be retired by request of affected countries if they have caused extensive damage. The affected countries then decide on a replacement name of the same gender (and if possible, the same ethnicity) as the name being retired.\n\nIf there are more than 21 named storms in an Atlantic season or 24 named storms in an Eastern Pacific season, the rest are named as letters from the Greek alphabet: the 22nd storm is called \"Alpha,\" the 23rd \"Beta,\" and so on. This was first necessary during the 2005 season when the names Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Epsilon were all used.

This is bcause this number is the average of all isotopes.  An isotope is an element that has a different number of neutrons.  For example, a hydrogen atom with one proton and neutron in the nucleus, and an electron orbiting it is still hydrogen, but is known as deuterium (It is still defined as hydrogen by the number of protons in the nucleus), but has an atomic mass of 2. The other isotope of hydrogen (Tritium) has 2 neutrons in the nucleus and an electron orbiting it (an atomic mass of 3). Because these isotopes are so rare, the average mass of all existing hydrogen is close to 1, but is slightly higher.\n\nYou can find mass in Kg by dividing the atomic mass by avogadro's number (6.02 X 10^23).  There are 6.02X10^23 atomic mass units in 1Kg.","If you would like an online calculator to help you, you could try: http:\/\/environmentalchemistry.com\/yogi\/reference\/molar.html","These actually work.

Perhaps try copper and steel or copper and aluminum or steel and aluminum.  Try perhaps one half inch wide by six inch long strips.  Use sheets of metal that are equally thin.  Perhaps cut the strips from aluminum soda cans and steel soup cans, etc.  Use a magnet to check for steel vs aluminum.  Glue the strips together using epoxy or super glue.  Attach one end of the combined strip to a firm base and leave one end free to move in front of a paper scale.  You now have a bimetalic thermometer.  The thermometer can be made to be more sensitive by using greater length strips and bending the strips into a spiral and attaching a pointer to the free end of the spiral to amplify movement.  This is how most oven thermometers are built except the metals are joined without glue.  The principal of operation of a bimetalic thermometer is that one  metal expands or contracts more or less than another metal.  When joined, a temperature change causes the combined strip to bend.  You can calibrate your thermometer by marking its &quot;pointer&quot; position at two or more large temperature changes then calculating the total deflection divided by the total temperature difference to get deflection per degree (either F or C).  Be careful with tin snips and epoxy or super glue.  Good luck.\n\nAs an alternative, you can make a highly accurate experimental thermometer by winding very thin insulated copper wire (like that used in toy motors) around a wooden spool and connecting the scraped   wire ends to an accurate ohmmeter to measure resistance change vs temperature change.  Calibrate as before but remember that calibration temperatures must be steady long enough for any lag to catch up.  This is called a resitance thermometer and accuracy will depend on the length and thinness of wire and sensitivity of your ohmmeter.  Also the ohmmeter should not cause enough current to flow in the wire to heat the wire.  Observe for drift (increase in resistance and temperature) while taking measurements.","You could try to make an accurate experimental thermometer by glueing two strips of dissimilar metals together along their lengths.

As the river opens into the ocean at the delta the velocity of the water slows and the ability of the river to carry sediments decreases, creating a huge sediment buildup at the mouth of the river. Other processes near the mouth of the river that gradually build the delta and coastal wetlands are from periodic flooding of the river. When the river flows over its banks during flood it carries these sediments out onto the flood plain where they settle out of the water. This process has been going on for millions of years and has built much of the coastal area of Louisiana, just as other rivers along the Gulf Coast have built the Texas shoreline and progressively moved it forward into the Gulf. \n\nThe Mississippi has not always been contained by levee systems, and when allowed to flow naturally the mouth of the river has migrated back and forth across the Louisiana coastal plain. At present there is speculation that the river, if allowed, would begin flowing across the Achafalaya area rather than taking the path it now takes to the sea. \n\nYou might be interested to know that the sediment pile created by the Mississippi River is over 30,000 feet deep along the Louisiana coastline.","The Mississippi River drains most of the North American continent and carries a huge sediment load of clay, silt, sand, and even gravel sized clasts all the way to its mouth.

Although stronger than most other intermolecular forces, the typical hydrogen bond is much weaker than both the ionic bond and the covalent bond. Within macromolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids, it can exist between two parts of the same molecule, and figures as an important constraint on such molecules' overall shape.\n\nAs the name &quot;hydrogen bond&quot; implies, one part of the bond involves a hydrogen atom. The hydrogen must be attached to a strongly electronegative heteroatom, such as oxygen, nitrogen or fluorine, which is called the hydrogen-bond donor. This electronegative element attracts the electron cloud from around the hydrogen nucleus and, by decentralizing the cloud, leaves the atom with a positive partial charge. Because of the small size of hydrogen relative to other atoms and molecules, the resulting charge, though only partial, nevertheless represents a large charge density. A hydrogen bond results when this strong positive charge density attracts a lone pair of electrons on another heteroatom, which becomes the hydrogen-bond acceptor","In chemistry, a hydrogen bond is a type of attractive intermolecular force that exists between two partial electric charges of opposite polarity.

Since there is a localization of electrons around the Oxygen, it would have a slightly negative charge in the molecule.

Therefore, the electron field of the molecule would mostly be focused on the oxygen.

Therefore, this H--O interaction is the hydrogen bonding we are all looking at; this creates such a significant effect that when you compare water to other molecules such as ammonium or even CH4.","Hydrogen bonding is a relatively strong type of bonding.

The answer is the prism breaks the white light into visible color, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet (these are the rainbow color).  Our atmosphere is filled with dust particles.  So when sun ray hits the particles in the atmosphere, it breaks the white light like the prism.  The color blue has the strongest wavelength out the rainbow colors.

This significantly diminishes the pressure of air on the wing; the difference of pressure under and over the wings creates the necessary lift for flight.\n\nAlso they obey, on a smaller scale, the laws of inertia as formulated by Isaac Newton: a force acting in one given direction tends to be balanced by another force with same intensity, and of opposing direction.

To reach these high speeds, an airplane needs to cover a certain distance on the ground, before reaching the speed needed for take-off. For larger and heavier aircraft it will generally require a longer runway to reach the necessary speed for the take-off, given the larger amount of energy needed.","An airplane flies due to the aerodynamic reactions that happen when air passes at high speed over the wing.\n\nWhen air passes over the wing, it is forced to pass underneath or over top of it.

The plane's wings push this airstream downward and the airstream reacts by pushing the wings upward. This action\/reaction effect is an example of Newton's third law of motion, which observes that forces always come in equal but oppositely directed pairs: if one object pushes on another, then the second object must push back on the first object with a force of equal strength pointing in the opposite direction. Even air obeys this law so that when the plane's wings push air downward, the air must push the wings upward in response. In level flight, the deflected air pushes upward so hard that it supports the entire weight of the plane. Just how the airplane's wings deflect the airstream downward to obtain this upward lift force is a marvel of fluid dynamics. We can view it from at least two perspectives: a Newtonian perspective which concentrates on the accelerations of the passing airstream and a Bernoullian perspective which concentrates on speeds and pressures in that airstream.\n\nThe Newtonian perspective is the most intuitive and where we will start. The airstream arriving at the forward or \"leading\" edge of the airplane wing splits into two separate flows that travel over and under the wing, respectively. The wing is shaped and tilted so that these two flows experience very different accelerations as they travel around the wing. The flow that goes under the wing encounters a downward sloping surface that pushes it downward and it accelerates downward. In response to this downward push, the air pushes upward on the bottom of the wing and provides part of the force that supports the plane.\n\nThe air that flows over the wing follows a more complicated route. At first, this flow encounters an upward sloping surface that pushes it upward and it accelerates upward. In response to this upward force, the air pushes downward on the leading portion of the wing's top surface. But the wing's top surface is curved so that it soon begins to slope downward rather than upward. When this happens, the airflow must accelerate downward to stay in contact with it. A suction effect appears, in which the rear or \"trailing\" portion of the wing's top surface sucks downward on the air and the air sucks upward on it in response. This upward suction force more than balances the downward force at the leading edge of the wing so that the air flowing over the wing provides an overall upward force on the wing.\n\nSince both of these air flows produce upward forces on the wing, they act together to support the airplane's weight. The air passing both under and over the wings is deflected downward and the plane remains suspended.\n\nIn the Bernoullian view, air flowing around a wing's sloping surfaces experiences changes in speed and pressure that lead to an overall upward force on the wing. The fact that each speed change is accompanied by a pressure change is the result of a conservation of energy in air passing a stationary surface--when the air's speed and motional energy increase, the air's pressure and pressure energy must decrease to compensate. In short, when air flowing around the wing speeds up, its pressure drops and when it slows down, its pressure rises.\n\nWhen air going under the wing encounters the downward sloping bottom surface, it slows down. As a result, the air's pressure rises and it exerts a strong upward force on the wing. But when air going over the wing encounters the up and down sloping top surface, it slows down and then speeds up. As a result, the air's pressure first rises and then drops dramatically, and it exerts a very weak overall downward force on the wing. Because the upward force on the bottom of the wing is much stronger than the downward force on the top of the wing, there is an upward overall pressure force on the wing. This upward force can be strong enough to su","I happen to fly a lot on business. For me, personally, airplanes are one of the most amazing things that I see on a daily basis. When I get on a 747, I am boarding a gigantic vehicle capable of carrying 500 or 600 people. A 747 weighs up to 870,000 pounds at takeoff. Yet it rolls down the runway and, as though by magic, lifts itself into the air and can fly up to 7,000 nautical miles without stopping. It is truly incredible when you think about it! \n\nIf you have ever wondered what allows a 747 -- or any airplane for that matter -- to fly, then read on. In this article, we will walk through the theory of flight and talk about the different parts of a standard airplane, and then you can explore tons of links to learn even more. \n\nAerodynamic Forces\nBefore we dive into how wings keep airplanes up in the air, it's important that we take a look at four basic aerodynamic forces: lift, weight, thrust and drag. \n\nStraight and Level Flight\nIn order for an airplane to fly straight and level, the following relationships must be true: \n\nThrust = Drag \nLift = Weight \nIf, for any reason, the amount of drag becomes larger than the amount of thrust, the plane will slow down. If the thrust is increased so that it is greater than the drag, the plane will speed up. \nSimilarly, if the amount of lift drops below the weight of the airplane, the plane will descend. By increasing the lift, the pilot can make the airplane climb. \n\nThrust\nThrust is an aerodynamic force that must be created by an airplane in order to overcome the drag (notice that thrust and drag act in opposite directions in the figure above). Airplanes create thrust using propellers, jet engines or rockets. In the figure above, the thrust is being created with a propeller, which acts like a very powerful version of a household fan, pulling air past the blades. \n\nFor More Details : http:\/\/travel.howstuffworks.com\/airplane1.htm","Use the vlookup formula on the codes to reference back to the original sheet.","Use the vlookup formula on the codes to reference back to the original sheet.","a good answer up there - vote for it!","Richard Feynman (the greatest scientist ever) believed that science is best defined as the belief that &quot;...observation is the ultimate and final judge of the truth of an idea.&quot;  The scientific method isn't strictly followed in science (you won't find physicists going step by step through some list).

Nothing will protect your interests better than doing your homework before signing a contract.  To find prospective Contractors, ask your friends and neighbors for referrals.  Contact your local chapter of the National Association of Homebuilders if available in your area.  Many Realtors are also familiar with local Contractors and may offer referrals.  Your local Building Inspector may be able to give you a list of local Contractors but is unlikley to make recommendations because of conflicts of interest.\n\nBefore you shop for a Contractor, do both you and your prospective Contractor a favor and determine exactly the scope of the job they are to price.  Drawings and specifications are essential.  If each of your prospective Contractors prepares estimates on exactly the same work, you will better be able to make an informed buying decision.\n\nOnce you have a list of prospective Contractors, narrow down the list using the following criteria:\n\n- Must have been in business at least ten years.  Most Contractors offer written warranties, but they aren't worth the paper upon which they are written if the contractor goes out of business.\n\n- Most General Contractors subcontract parts of a project such as plumbing and electrical to other licensed Contractors.  Some Contractors subcontract all of a project to others.  Make sure that the Contractor you choose performs the bulk of the work with his own employees.  A Contractor that subcontracts most, or all of the job has little or no control over the quality or timeliness of a project.\n\n- Make sure your General Contractor is licensed if required by law.  Don't take their word for it, ask to see a copy of the license and demand a photo copy of the same for your records.\n\n- Make sure your Contractor is covered by general liability and workers compensation insurance.  Again ask for a &quot;Certificate of Insurance&quot; that will identify the amounts and types of coverage.  A legitimate Contractor will simply call his insurer and have them mail you a copy.  Accept no substitite as they are easily &quot;phonied up&quot;.  Review with your Attorney if needed.\n\n- Do not rely on the Better Business Bureau.  While their information can be helpful, it is by no means definitive.  Even the worst Contractor may have no record with them.  \n\n- Talk to your Attorney regarding your State's Lein laws.  You may be able to arrange a &quot;Release of Lein&quot; when you pay your Contractor.  If your Contractor fails to pay his subcontractors or material suppliers, you may find yourself liable for the bills he failed to pay.  A &quot;Release of Lein&quot; may protect you from having to pay for the work twice.\n\n- NEVER give your Contractor a large percentage of the total contract price as a downpayment.  A ten percent deposit is reasonable and many reputable Contractors will work on jobs under $5,000.00 with no downpayment at all, with the balance due upon completion.  You can assume that a Contractor that requires a large downpayment is using your money for working capital and will not be in business long.  Don't be the one holding the bag when he bails out. \n\n- If you finance your project, do not sign a completion document before the work is done.  You can be sure that a contractor who pressures you to sign a completion before the work is done will be almost impossible to get in touch with once he has your money.  You will have lost all of your leverage.\n\n- Make sure that all agreements are in writing and are as specific as is reasonably possible.  Drawings and specifications should be part of any written agreement as should provisions for the documentation of inevitable &quot;Change Orders&quot;.  If you are at all uncomfortable with a proposed agreement, have it reviewed by your Attorney before signing.

Keep in mind that most floors, carpet and floating wood, can be installed right over existing tile.

In any case, I'd suggest getting students at ease in the standardized test taking environment.  Give them some experience before test days with time constraints and answer grids.  For goodness sake, don't make a test seem like the whole future of the school district is dependent on their performance!  Talk about test anxiety!  Perhaps counselors have a role too in helping students who appear to be stressed by the experience with a few relaxation techniques.  Your mind works like a file system, and the lower the stress, the more you are able to recall from the material that you actually do know.","try to get them interested in wut there learning.\ntry to fnd games and fun wways to teach.","I recommend tables of conversion factors or units.

I begin with a truism: taxes impose a cost on the taxpayer. It is tempting to view the cost as simply the amount of money that he or she pays to the government. However, this is only part of the story. A tax distorts economic behavior--in general, consumers buy fewer taxed goods and more untaxed goods than otherwise would have been the case. Their decisions are not based entirely on the merits of the commodities themselves. The same logic applies to individuals' decisions about the amount of labor to supply and the amount to save. And similarly, business owners make investments based in part on tax considerations, as opposed to economic fundamentals. Because a tax distorts economic activity, it creates a loss in welfare that actually exceeds the revenues collected. Economists refer to this as the excess burden of the tax. An excess burden represents pure waste to the economy--it is not a transfer of economic resources from one person or group to another; it is simply a loss to the economy as a whole. Excess burden is the economist's standard measure of the efficiency of the tax system. \n\nExcess burdens depend on the marginal tax rate levied on an activity--the tax rate on the last dollar generated by that activity. An important result is that the excess burden of a tax increases with the square of the tax rate --doubling a tax quadruples its excess burden, other things being the same. This means that, in general, high marginal tax rates exact a high toll on the economy. One recent academic study calculated that in the United States , the marginal excess burden of the income tax--the incremental excess burden associated with the last dollar of revenue collected--is 35.2 cents (Jorgenson and Yun [2001, p. 302]). To see the implications of this estimate, note that the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that, in fiscal 2010, the reduction in taxes associated with lower marginal tax rates will be $118.4 billion. This will reduce excess burden in that year by $41.7 billion (=$118.4 billion x 0.352). In effect, this will have the same impact on American taxpayers' well-being as if they had received a $41.7 billion lump-sum tax rebate. To put this figure in perspective, note that it is roughly the size of the rebates of $36 billion that taxpayers received in 2001. Of course, any particular figure must be taken with a grain of salt, but virtually all estimates suggest that the U.S. tax system is highly inefficient in the sense of generating large excess burdens. \n\nIn all the official documents relating to the details of government spending and taxing, one would look in vain for an &ldquo;excess burden budget&rdquo; documenting the distortionary impact of government fiscal policies. It is not hard to understand why. Excess burden does not appear in anyone's bookkeeping system; it is conceptually a rather subtle notion; and it is not trivial to calculate. Nevertheless, although the losses in real income associated with tax-induced changes in behavior are hidden, they are real, and they are probably very large. Reductions in marginal tax rates are the centerpiece of EGTRRA. These reductions will substantially reduce excess burdens in the economy. Making the tax law permanent would lock in this benefit--the &ldquo;rebates&rdquo; associated with lower excess burdens would be repeated every year. Indeed, the rebates would grow with the size of the economy. Assuming a long-term growth rate of 3 percent, by the year 2020, the annual reduction in excess burden from making the tax reductions permanent would be about $56 billion. \n\nAnother source of excess burdens is the corporate income tax, which taxes the returns of corporate shareholders twice, once when earned at the corporate level, and again when received by shareholders, either in the form of dividends or capital gains. Double taxation di","While the new tax laws have a number of provisions, at their heart is a reduction in personal income tax rates, and that will be my main focus. I begin with a truism: taxes impose a cost on the taxpayer. It is tempting to view the cost as simply the amount of money that he or she pays to the government. However, this is only part of the story. A tax distorts economic behavior--in general, consumers buy fewer taxed goods and more untaxed goods than otherwise would have been the case. Their decisions are not based entirely on the merits of the commodities themselves. The same logic applies to individuals' decisions about the amount of labor to supply and the amount to save. And similarly, business owners make investments based in part on tax considerations, as opposed to economic fundamentals. Because a tax distorts economic activity, it creates a loss in welfare that actually exceeds the revenues collected. Economists refer to this as the excess burden of the tax. An excess burden represents pure waste to the economy--it is not a transfer of economic resources from one person or group to another; it is simply a loss to the economy as a whole. Excess burden is the economist's standard measure of the efficiency of the tax system. \n\nExcess burdens depend on the marginal tax rate levied on an activity--the tax rate on the last dollar generated by that activity. An important result is that the excess burden of a tax increases with the square of the tax rate --doubling a tax quadruples its excess burden, other things being the same. This means that, in general, high marginal tax rates exact a high toll on the economy. One recent academic study calculated that in the United States , the marginal excess burden of the income tax--the incremental excess burden associated with the last dollar of revenue collected--is 35.2 cents (Jorgenson and Yun [2001, p. 302]). To see the implications of this estimate, note that the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that, in fiscal 2010, the reduction in taxes associated with lower marginal tax rates will be $118.4 billion. This will reduce excess burden in that year by $41.7 billion (=$118.4 billion x 0.352). In effect, this will have the same impact on American taxpayers' well-being as if they had received a $41.7 billion lump-sum tax rebate. To put this figure in perspective, note that it is roughly the size of the rebates of $36 billion that taxpayers received in 2001. Of course, any particular figure must be taken with a grain of salt, but virtually all estimates suggest that the U.S. tax system is highly inefficient in the sense of generating large excess burdens. \n\nIn all the official documents relating to the details of government spending and taxing, one would look in vain for an \u201cexcess burden budget\u201d documenting the distortionary impact of government fiscal policies. It is not hard to understand why. Excess burden does not appear in anyone's bookkeeping system; it is conceptually a rather subtle notion; and it is not trivial to calculate. Nevertheless, although the losses in real income associated with tax-induced changes in behavior are hidden, they are real, and they are probably very large. Reductions in marginal tax rates are the centerpiece of EGTRRA. These reductions will substantially reduce excess burdens in the economy. Making the tax law permanent would lock in this benefit--the \u201crebates\u201d associated with lower excess burdens would be repeated every year. Indeed, the rebates would grow with the size of the economy. Assuming a long-term growth rate of 3 percent, by the year 2020, the annual reduction in excess burden from making the tax reductions permanent would be about $56 billion. \n\nAnother source of excess burdens is the corporate income tax, which taxes the returns of corporate shareholders twice, once when earned at the corporate level, and again when received by shareholders, either in the form of dividends or capital gains.

Look at it this way, if you work for someone else, you can pretty accurately predict what your salary will be over 5 years (even optimistically)- and it will probably be no where near $1 mil.\n\nSo, Here's the plan.\n\n1. Start your own business.  You should do something you LIKE to do.\n\n2. Set a target for who you are marketing to, and what product or service you are providing.  Define that well, on paper.  Perhaps you want to provide computer programming services for accounting firms, or provide financial planning services for wealthy men (&gt;$2M net worth) in their 40's.  Whatever.  Define it well.  This sets your target customer.  It guides your efforts.\n\n3. Every SPARE moment goes toward building a business for your target... finding customers in that arena, building a product or service offering in that target range.\n\n4. Set a financial goal.  If you want to earn (gross) $1M in 5 yrs, maybe it looks like this:  Yr 1: 25K, Yr 2: 70K, Yr 3: 130K, Yr 4: 260K, Yr 5: 520K.  That would put you over 1M for the total, and with a growth rate that would put you over $1M in yr 6 as well.\n\n5.  PUT A PLAN ON PAPER.  What does yr 2 look like?  Who are you selling to, and what are you selling?  How many customers do you need?  How many employees do you need?  What does a budget look like?  (where would you be spending your money in year 2, to insure that year 3 produces the results that you need).  It's a GIVEN that your plan will be WRONG (one way or another), but it's CRITICAL that you do this ON PAPER.\n\n6. Read The E-Myth.  Michael Gerber lays out a roadmap.  (That was a guide for our multi-million dollar start-up)\n\n7. Hire people ONLY IF YOU MUST, and then HIRE PEOPLE SMARTER THAN YOU.  This is critical.  Most start-ups go &quot;on the cheap&quot;.  Most start-ups fail.  Look for people that have succeeded in starting a business.\n\n8. Put your business plan into a &quot;presentation&quot;, and present it to as MANY influential people as possible.  Amazingly MOST EVERYONE is supportive of the little guy who has the guts to go out on a limb.  Listen to their advice (and weigh it accordingly).  This is part &quot;strategic planning&quot; and part &quot;marketing&quot;.  You are just trying to get the message out.  At the end of each presentation, ask &quot;do you know of anyone who I should talk to, who would be interested in my product or service?&quot;  Get leads.  Follow up on them.\n\n9. Keeping your eye on your target market and financial goals, turn down VERY LITTLE business down (initially) until you can meet your financial target.  Price your deals based on how close to the target they are.  For instance, if you choose to perform Landscaping for businesses, but someone asks you to help them with a residential job, bid the job so that it's &quot;worth your time&quot;.  Don't ever complain that &quot;this isn't my core business&quot;.  The only business you want to avoid in the early stages are the deals that don't have a clean exit or a paying customer.  If you can state your price, and do a job, and have a satisfied customer, and make a few bucks, that is golden!  You are looking for reference accounts.\n\n10.  When you are so busy that you have the luxury of being selective of the business that you take on, price yourself accordingly.  Some business you may want to say no to.  Other business you may want to price high.  Remember the TARGET set in Step 2.  If it's a &quot;bullseye&quot; deal (exactly the type of business you are looking for, with a customer that will be happy and refer","Start with Ten Mil and invest it in the stock market.\n\nWith some luck, you'll earn $1 mil (which is what I THINK you meant to ask).\n\nIf you lose 90%, you'll still have $1 mil.\n\n------------\n\nSeriously, as one who has done what you are looking to do, with the success levels you are talking about, I have to say that the BEST way to make a lot of money is to start your own business.

This sets your target customer.  It guides your efforts.\n\n3. Every SPARE moment goes toward building a business for your target... finding customers in that arena, building a product or service offering in that target range.\n\n4. Set a financial goal.  If you want to earn (gross) $1M in 5 yrs, maybe it looks like this:  Yr 1: 25K, Yr 2: 70K, Yr 3: 130K, Yr 4: 260K, Yr 5: 520K.  That would put you over 1M for the total, and with a growth rate that would put you over $1M in yr 6 as well.\n\n5.  PUT A PLAN ON PAPER.  What does yr 2 look like?  Who are you selling to, and what are you selling?  How many customers do you need?  How many employees do you need?  What does a budget look like?  (where would you be spending your money in year 2, to insure that year 3 produces the results that you need).  It's a GIVEN that your plan will be WRONG (one way or another), but it's CRITICAL that you do this ON PAPER.\n\n6. Read The E-Myth.  Michael Gerber lays out a roadmap.  (That was a guide for our multi-million dollar start-up)\n\n7. Hire people ONLY IF YOU MUST, and then HIRE PEOPLE SMARTER THAN YOU.  This is critical.  Most start-ups go \"on the cheap\".  Most start-ups fail.  Look for people that have succeeded in starting a business.\n\n8. Put your business plan into a \"presentation\", and present it to as MANY influential people as possible.  Amazingly MOST EVERYONE is supportive of the little guy who has the guts to go out on a limb.  Listen to their advice (and weigh it accordingly).  This is part \"strategic planning\" and part \"marketing\".  You are just trying to get the message out.  At the end of each presentation, ask \"do you know of anyone who I should talk to, who would be interested in my product or service?\"  Get leads.  Follow up on them.\n\n9. Keeping your eye on your target market and financial goals, turn down VERY LITTLE business down (initially) until you can meet your financial target.  Price your deals based on how close to the target they are.  For instance, if you choose to perform Landscaping for businesses, but someone asks you to help them with a residential job, bid the job so that it's \"worth your time\".  Don't ever complain that \"this isn't my core business\".  The only business you want to avoid in the early stages are the deals that don't have a clean exit or a paying customer.  If you can state your price, and do a job, and have a satisfied customer, and make a few bucks, that is golden!  You are looking for reference accounts.\n\n10.  When you are so busy that you have the luxury of being selective of the business that you take on, price yourself accordingly.  Some business you may want to say no to.  Other business you may want to price high.  Remember the TARGET set in Step 2.  If it's a \"bullseye\" deal (exactly the type of business you are looking for, with a customer that will be happy and refer","learn to trade forex.  use a practice account, get a good strategy then apply it to your real account.  you can trade rather conservatively too since you're giving yourself 5 years.","I went to a business seminar and Phil Town taught people how to make at least a million in 10 years using the stock market.\n\nHere's a link. http:\/\/www.philtown.typepad.com\/","I went to a business seminar and Phil Town taught people how to make at least a million in 10 years using the stock market.\n\nHere's a link. http:\/\/www.philtown.typepad.com\/","By making at least $100,000 every year.","You can ask the doctors or other hospital authorities about it.","You can ask the doctors or other hospital authorities about it.","Search Google","Go here and enter your zip code.  http:\/\/www.pervwatch.org\/counties\/map\/178","Go here and enter your zip code.  http:\/\/www.pervwatch.org\/counties\/map\/178","Use any search engine, and search for 'sex offender' and your state.

Look at it this way, if you work for someone else, you can pretty accurately predict what your salary will be over 5 years (even optimistically)- and it will probably be no where near $1 mil.\n\nSo, Here's the plan.\n\n1. Start your own business. You should do something you LIKE to do.\n\n2. Set a target for who you are marketing to, and what product or service you are providing. Define that well, on paper. Perhaps you want to provide computer programming services for accounting firms, or provide financial planning services for wealthy men (&gt;$2M net worth) in their 40's. Whatever. Define it well. This sets your target customer. It guides your efforts.\n\n3. Every SPARE moment goes toward building a business for your target... finding customers in that arena, building a product or service offering in that target range.\n\n4. Set a financial goal. If you want to earn (gross) $1M in 5 yrs, maybe it looks like this: Yr 1: 25K, Yr 2: 70K, Yr 3: 130K, Yr 4: 260K, Yr 5: 520K. That would put you over 1M for the total, and with a growth rate that would put you over $1M in yr 6 as well.\n\n5. PUT A PLAN ON PAPER. What does yr 2 look like? Who are you selling to, and what are you selling? How many customers do you need? How many employees do you need? What does a budget look like? (where would you be spending your money in year 2, to insure that year 3 produces the results that you need). It's a GIVEN that your plan will be WRONG (one way or another), but it's CRITICAL that you do this ON PAPER.\n\n6. Read The E-Myth. Michael Gerber lays out a roadmap. (That was a guide for our multi-million dollar start-up)\n\n7. Hire people ONLY IF YOU MUST, and then HIRE PEOPLE SMARTER THAN YOU. This is critical. Most start-ups go &quot;on the cheap&quot;. Most start-ups fail. Look for people that have succeeded in starting a business.\n\n8. Put your business plan into a &quot;presentation&quot;, and present it to as MANY influential people as possible. Amazingly MOST EVERYONE is supportive of the little guy who has the guts to go out on a limb. Listen to their advice (and weigh it accordingly). This is part &quot;strategic planning&quot; and part &quot;marketing&quot;. You are just trying to get the message out. At the end of each presentation, ask &quot;do you know of anyone who I should talk to, who would be interested in my product or service?&quot; Get leads. Follow up on them.\n\n9. Keeping your eye on your target market and financial goals, turn down VERY LITTLE business down (initially) until you can meet your financial target. Price your deals based on how close to the target they are. For instance, if you choose to perform Landscaping for businesses, but someone asks you to help them with a residential job, bid the job so that it's &quot;worth your time&quot;. Don't ever complain that &quot;this isn't my core business&quot;. The only business you want to avoid in the early stages are the deals that don't have a clean exit or a paying customer.

When you are so busy that you have the luxury of being selective of the business that you take on, price yourself accordingly. Some business you may want to say no to.

If it's far from the bullseye, then raise your price, or don't bid on it.

The thing is that in case you want to make money, you got to Patent.

The thing is that in case you want to make money, you got to Patent. However, patenting does involve a lot of money, generally people hire attorneys to make their case strong for consideration for a patent.

Then wait the time for them to clear.  As long as you owe money, they're not going anywhere.  It also takes 4-7 years to clear off of your credit report once you have paid them off.  IN the meantime it will show as paid off, which is a lot better than money owed.\n\nThere are services which will offer to \"clear\" your credit for you, but in reality, there isn't a legal, legitimate way to do it unless the items on there are not ones that you really owe.  What they try to do is to challenge the claim in the hope that the company that you owe money to won't respond.  If they don't, it comes off of your credit report until the next time they update it.  Then it's right back on there again.  Other methods are illegal and will get you, and them, in trouble.  Not to mention they're all a waste of your hard earned money that you could have used instead to pay towards the debt.","Would apply for entry level job.

When the film is developed, the parts that were exposed to light turn to metallic silver, while the other parts get washed away.  So the parts that were exposed to the most light (brightest) in the original image will now be the most opaque and the parts that were originally darkest will now be transparent.  That gives you a negative.\n\nTo convert the negative into a regular picture, you shine a light through the negative onto a piece of photographic paper.  This paper works the same way as the film.  Since the light will be brighter where the negative is more transparent and darker where it's more opaque, the resulting print will have light and dark reversed -- back to the way it appeared in the original image.","Start reading up and following news on funding.

If you are not a California resident, see Out-of-State Applicants.\nHonesty:  Applicants must be honest and truthful. Conviction of a crime may result in the denial of a license. Failure to disclose any criminal violation or disciplinary action in an applicant's entire history may also result in the denial of a license.

How old was the king when he died? Did he suffer from any physical abnormalities? Had he been murdered? Many of these questions were finally answered in early 2005 when the results of a set of CT scans on the mummy were released.\n\nThe body was originally inspected by Howard Carter&rsquo;s team in the early 1920s, though they were primarily interested in recovering the jewelry and amulets from the body. To remove the objects from the body, which in many cases were stuck fast by the hardened embalming resins used, Carter's team cut up the mummy into various pieces: the arms and legs were detached, the torso cut in half and the head was severed. Hot knives were used to remove it from the golden mask to which it was cemented by resin. Since the body was placed back in its sarcophagus in 1926, the mummy has subsequently been X-rayed three times: first in 1968 by a group from the University of Liverpool, then in 1978 by a group from the University of Michigan and finally in 2005 a team of Egyptian scientists led by Dr. Zahi Hawass, Secretary General of the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities, conducted a CT scan on the mummy.\n\nEarly (pre-2005) X-rays of his mummy had revealed a dense spot at the lower back of the skull. This had been interpreted as a chronic subdural hematoma, which would have been caused by a blow. Such an injury could have been the result of an accident, but it had also been suggested that the young pharaoh was murdered. If this is the case, there are a number of theories as to who was responsible: one popular candidate was his immediate successor Ay. Interestingly, there are seemingly signs of calcification within the supposed injury, which if true meant Tutankhamun lived for a fairly extensive period of time (on the order of several months) after the injury was inflicted.\n\nMuch confusion had been caused by a small loose sliver of bone within the upper cranial cavity, which was discovered from the same X-ray analysis. Some people have mistaken this visible bone fragment for the supposed head injury. In fact, since Tutankhamun's brain was removed post mortem in the mummification process, and considerable quantities of now-hardened resin introduced into the skull on at least two separate occasions after that, had the fragment resulted from a pre-mortem injury, it almost certainly would not still be loose in the cranial cavity. It therefore almost certainly represented post-mummification damage.","For a long time the cause of Tutankhamun's death was unknown, and was the root of much speculation.

Hawass said one factor included the fact that the conditions of his burial in the tomb seemed \"hurried.\" \n\nTutankhamun ruled about 3 300 years ago and is believed to be the 12th ruler of ancient Egypt's 18th dynasty. He ascended to the throne at about the age of 8 and died around 1323 BC at approximately 17. \n\nTut's lineage also has long been in question. It's unclear if he is the son or a half-brother of Akhenaten, the \"heretic\" pharaoh who introduced a revolutionary form of monotheism to ancient Egypt and who was the son of Amenhotep III. \n\nThe examination had raised a row among archaeologists and officials in Egypt, who insisted the mummy not be taken from Luxor, and that the research be done by Egyptians. The researchers originally had planned to move the mummy to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo for examination, but altered that after the outcry.","There are thousands of criteria that are included when a search engine database qualifies web pages for listing in search results.

It helps to read several books (e.g. Automatic Millionaire) but the real question is, &quot;Do you have the responsibility to spend less than you make and automatically save some every paycheck?&quot; Income doesn't really matter if you can find a way to save $200\/month. You may not think that it's possible to save $2,400\/year and reach a million dollars, but that's the benefit of compound interest. There will be a certain point in your savings, perhaps after 26 years of constantly saving $200\/month in an index mutual fund that gives you a return of 10% or so, the interest you make will begin to grow by the hundreds and thousands.  From that 27th year on up to your 40th year, the interest will grow so fast that you will have a million dollars.  The question is, did you begin saving when you were 20 years old, or when you were 40 years old.  Depending on when you began, you'd be a millionaire at 60 or at 80, a huge difference.  Of course that could also be changed by saving more per month.  It's possible but best to read up on lots of books and see the real cost of becoming a millionaire.  It might be the difference between spending $8 for lunch every day or spending $4 for lunch every day.  A small sacrifice today can yield huge returns later.","Making a million dollars throughout one's lifetime is not a difficult task anymore.

Generally this involves buying a lottery ticket at your favorite retailer and then eagerly waiting for the right numbers to come up.\n\nA bit harder way to earn a million dollars is through salary and earnings. Start a business, or become a professional that makes at least $100,000 a year. Live well below your means and accummulate. Within several years and interest accummulating on the account, you should receive a bank statement with a seven-digit figure in it.\n\nA harder way would be to start a business and come up with a product or service that at a price of $100 would attract 10,000 buyers.","Get a good Color Laser Printer.  Did you want to MAKE a million, or EARN it?\n\nSeriously, if you want to be a millionaire, and you have patience, it's not hard in today's environment.  Simply spend significanly less than you earn, for 25 years, and invest the difference.  (Been there, done that.)  You can do the math, but if you set aside $13,700 every year for 25 years, at 8% (stock-market-type gains), then you'll be at a million.\n\nIf you want to make it a little quicker, then you probably don't want to do it on an \"employees salary\", in which case you have to take bigger risks.  Starting a business is one of the best ways to achieve a million dollars.

So if you don't have rich parents, then you better get to work!  (been there and done that too!)\n\nDon't try to do something that no one else is doing.  Start a business ideas list.

Season the eggs with salt and beat the mixture with a fork or whisk until combined. Over-beating makes the eggs thin. As the eggs cook, the milk turns into steam, puffing up the eggs as they firm. The traces of sugar, fats and protein in the milk also help to make larger curds. The larger the curds, the more steam is trapped. Water will dilute the flavor and they will not be as soft and fluffy. Don&rsquo;t add more than five teaspoons of milk per egg, because the eggs can&rsquo;t absorb all that milk. &lt;br \/&gt;\n&lt;br \/&gt;\nCook the eggs in a heavy nonstick pan or a well-seasoned pan to prevent the eggs from sticking. Don&rsquo;t use too large a pan either, or the batter will spread out and cook too quickly. An eight-inch pan works well for two eggs, a 10-inch pan for four eggs. Preheating the pan over a medium heat also keeps the eggs from sticking. &lt;br \/&gt;\n&lt;br \/&gt;\nAdd butter or oil &ndash; about a teaspoon per egg &ndash; and heat it. Add the eggs and let them begin to set; then, with a heatproof rubber spatula, push the curds to one side and let the uncooked eggs spread over the surface of the pan. Repeat this action until the eggs are cooked to the desired degree of doneness &ndash; eggs taste best when slightly moist.","According to Food Network, use milk to make fluffier scrambled eggs. <br \/>\n<br \/>\nHere's a recipe from the Food Network Kitchens site:<br \/>\n<br \/>\nCrack the eggs into a bowl and whisk in the milk.

Watermelons are described below. As for cantaloupe: don't look, don't touch, just smell. Ripe cantaloupe smells very sweet and nice. Sniffing out the most aromatic one is the smartest way to pick a cantaloupe or honeydew. &lt;br \/&gt;\n2. Thump test: hold your dominant hand as if ready to knock on a door. Deliver two or three good thumps to the round side of a melon. The sound should be deep and thick, indicating a dense, full fruit. A higher hollow sound can mean unripeness. &lt;br \/&gt;\n3. If a honeydew is beige-skinned with distinct green veins it's probably not ripe yet. If it has a pale yellow color with bright, lemon-colored areas you probably have found a good one. &lt;br \/&gt;\nCantaloupes are unripe when the skin beneath the textured &quot;web&quot; is green. Cantaloupes are ripe when orange or gold. &lt;br \/&gt;\n4. Another mark of desirability is a patch that's slightly flat and bleached in color. Melons that develop on the vine flatten under their own weight, and lose color where they sit on hot soil. In general, stem ends should be moist, not moldy. A good melon is firm, but not rock hard. It yields very slightly to pressure but has no soft spots.   &lt;br \/&gt;\n5.

Dont go pulling out your spare and jack trying to get 2\/10 more mpg. Spark plugs arent really as important as you would think anymore, they last a lot of miles anymore. Spark plug wires should be check for resistance though and replaced if not within the specs. Your fuel injectors are more than likely fine unless you have tried to harm them. Dont buy anything from walmart that is a fuel injector cleaner. They are a WASTE and dont do anything at all. If you are serious about cleaning them, take it to a dealership or BG products and have them hook it up to a machine and pressure clean them. Fuel filters are very important and often overlooked so I would change it also. If you idle over 30 secs you can shut your car off to save fuel, it takes the same amount of fuel to idle for 30 secs as it does to start it. If you plan on keepin the car for a long time I would let it idle. Start up is generally hard on them, espicially v8s or diesels. But if you dont care and after 5 years you are tired of it, its no big deal shut it off and save the gas. If they are available you can get a free flowing exhaust and air intake that will give you 1 or 2 extra mpg but its up to you to decide whether you would make up the difference or not that you spent getting them.","I would also recommend the website below - AOPA (Airplane Owner and Pilot's Association) Flight Training web site.","I would also recommend the website below - AOPA (Airplane Owner and Pilot's Association) Flight Training web site.","Here's an excellent website, called BeAPilot.com, that helps you find flight schools, take a virtual tour, and just learn about flying in general: http:\/\/www.beapilot.com\/indexfl.html\n\nAlso, I recommend learning about aircraft controls with Microsoft Flight Simulator (any version except the \"special\" ones like combat, etc.)","You will need help.","You will need help.","Well there should be a bleeder screw on the top of the master cylinder.","Richmond, VA (RIC) to Georgetown, Guyana (GEO)  \nflight Cost  $1,125.20     \n6:30 pm Depart Richmond (RIC)\nArrive Georgetown,Guyana  (GEO) 8:05 pm\nSun  8-Jan\nDuration: 23hr 35mn\nDelta Delta 6059 operated by FREEDOM AIRLINES INC6059   \/ Delta 6069 operated by FREEDOM AIRLINES INC6069\nBWIA International \tBWIA International 431\nConnect in Orlando (MCO), Miami (MIA)\nTotal stops: 3\n\n 5:45 am Depart Georgetown,Guyana  (GEO)\nArrive Richmond (RIC) 9:51 pm\n Sun 25-Jun\nDuration: 18hr 6mn\nBWIA International 432\nDelta \tDelta Delta 6112 operated by FREEDOM AIRLINES INC6112  \/ Delta 6093 operated by FREEDOM AIRLINES INC6093\nConnect in Miami (MIA), Orlando (MCO)\nTotal stops: 3\n\nThat's the cheapest..","Richmond, VA (RIC) to Georgetown, Guyana (GEO)  \nflight Cost  $1,125.20     \n6:30 pm Depart Richmond (RIC)\nArrive Georgetown,Guyana  (GEO) 8:05 pm\nSun  8-Jan\nDuration: 23hr 35mn\nDelta Delta 6059 operated by FREEDOM AIRLINES INC6059   \/ Delta 6069 operated by FREEDOM AIRLINES INC6069\nBWIA International \tBWIA International 431\nConnect in Orlando (MCO), Miami (MIA)\nTotal stops: 3\n\n 5:45 am Depart Georgetown,Guyana  (GEO)\nArrive Richmond (RIC) 9:51 pm\n Sun 25-Jun\nDuration: 18hr 6mn\nBWIA International 432\nDelta \tDelta Delta 6112 operated by FREEDOM AIRLINES INC6112  \/ Delta 6093 operated by FREEDOM AIRLINES INC6093\nConnect in Miami (MIA), Orlando (MCO)\nTotal stops: 3\n\nThat's the cheapest..","Go to a Car stereo shop.

Most tires also have tread wear indicators that show as bars across the tire when there's insuffucuent tread.\n\nAnytime a tire has small cracks in the sidewall, or is mis-shapen in any way, it should be replaced.","check your owners manual if you do not have as a tire dealer he or she will look it up for you.","Start with the simple:\nReplace spark plugs\nChange Oil\nReplace Oil Filter\n\nWhite smoke is often burning oil.\n\nIf an oil change and spark plug change doesn't fix your problem try a thicker oil (try 20\/50 instead of 10\/40).\n\nIf your car creates tons of white smoke you might want to think about:\n\nCheck compression in the head with a compression gauge.\n\nIf compression is too low (need to check specs on your engine) then:\n\n1) Have valves ground (you could do this yourself, but paying a pro makes sense).\n\n2) Replace the rings on the pistons.\n\n3) Have head ground.\n\nIf this doesn't fix your problem, you need a major overhaul.","Start with the simple:\nReplace spark plugs\nChange Oil\nReplace Oil Filter\n\nWhite smoke is often burning oil.\n\nIf an oil change and spark plug change doesn't fix your problem try a thicker oil (try 20\/50 instead of 10\/40).\n\nIf your car creates tons of white smoke you might want to think about:\n\nCheck compression in the head with a compression gauge.\n\nIf compression is too low (need to check specs on your engine) then:\n\n1) Have valves ground (you could do this yourself, but paying a pro makes sense).\n\n2) Replace the rings on the pistons.\n\n3) Have head ground.\n\nIf this doesn't fix your problem, you need a major overhaul.","http:\/\/info.com\/","i dont deal with vw's but, you can try two people.  one to pry it open, and the other person to pull the hood.  its worked on alot of vehicles.  sometimes, its got a lever, in which it cant get over. thats why you need one person to try to open it , and the other to keep pulling the hood release...","i dont deal with vw's but, you can try two people.  one to pry it open, and the other person to pull the hood.  its worked on alot of vehicles.  sometimes, its got a lever, in which it cant get over. thats why you need one person to try to open it , and the other to keep pulling the hood release...","Im not sure if itll work on your VW but my Honda Civic hood gets stuck sometimes.

He attended Franklin College (University of Georgia), where he graduated with first honors at the age of twenty. Upon his graduation he moved to Columbus and there made his home for the rest of his life. At twenty-one he was admitted to the bar, and two years later was appointed solicitor-general for his judicial circuit. He afterward served a term in the General Assembly. On September 12, 1839, he married Mary Howard Jones of Columbus, by whom he had ten children, of whom five daughters survived him. His only son died of wounds received in the Civil War. Able, logical, industrious, and of the highest integrity, he had not a few of the qualities of Calhoun. He was convinced that to free the negroes would create such social chaos in the South as to make civilization impossible and life for the whites unendurable. He believed emancipation, and the subsequent enfranchisement of the slaves, inevitable if the South remained in the Union. He therefore became an ardent secessionist. But while he felt secession necessary he considered it by no means the solution to the problem. He feared some of the northermost slave states might, from economic reasons, develop a sentiment against the institution, and he would protect the lower South from the chaos of emancipation by the formation of a &quot;consolidated&quot; Southern Republic, with strong centralized powers, so that slavery could be put &quot;under the control of those most interested in it.&quot; (letter to Howell Cobb, Toombs, Stephens and Cobb Correspondence,&quot; American Historical Association Annual Report, 1911, II, 171). In the crisis of 1850 he was for immediate withdrawal from the Union, and became an enthusiastic supporter of the movement to hold a Southern Conference at Nashville. In the election held in Georgia to name delegatges to this conference he was successful, but most of the other secessionist candidates were overwhelmingly defeated, and the small number of votes cast showed that the vast majority of the people were not aroused. Indeed, the fact that Georgia, generally regarded as a pivotal state, had thus decisively repudiated the &quot;Southern-rights&quot; movement, foredoomed the convention to failure. But Benning was persistent and resourceful. Ostensibly, in an effort at compromise, he introduced at Nashville a resolution to the effect that nothing less than the Missouri line could be accepted by the South as a settlement of the territorial problem. He believed the South could be persuaded to demand this as an ultimatum; that the North would promptly reject it; and that secession would then be the only alternative. The resolution was duly passed, but the result was not what he had hoped it would be. Meeting in December, the Georgia Convention, instead of ratifying the action of Nashville, accepted Clay's compromise measure, &quot;being impelled thereto&quot; (in the language of the resolution) &quot;by an earnest desire to save the American Union.&quot; In 1851 Benning accepted the nomination of the Southern Rights Democrats as one of their candidates for Congress and, although he ran ahead of his party, was defeated in the Constitutional Union &quot;landslide&quot; of that year. In 1853 he was elected by the General Assembly as an associate justice of the Georgia supreme court, where he delivered, in the case of Padelford vs. Savannah (14 Georgia,438) an exhaustive opinion in support of the principle that a state supreme court is not bound by the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States on constitutional questions.

Strictly, it is not totally possible to &quot;win&quot; except in a few tetris variants and in player vs. player mode.\n\nNow if you'd like to do well in tetris, here are the ways to achieve the two goals:\n\n1) High points.  Usually getting a tetris (clearing 4 lines at once) is the highest scoring thing you can do.  So getting the highest number of points is equivalent to getting the most tetrises.  The tetris can only be gotten using the long rectangular piece, and there are two schools of thought on how to play.  One school of thought is to the empty slot on the edge of the board.  This gives a 9 block wide mass on which to build.  Generally it is easier to manage this because fewer block masses means less complexity in placement, and fewer problems with &quot;towers&quot;.  The other school of thought is to have your empty slot right in the middle, in the spot where pressing rotate once will allow your rectangular piece to complete the tetris.  The reason that this is done is in higher levels where pieces fall quickly, there is less time to respond, and if your stack gets high while you are waiting for a long rectangle, then you risk not having enough time to get it to the edge of the board to complete the tetris when it *does* come.  This method will mean that you have two block regions to manage though.\n\n2) Completely levels quickly.  Levels are usually advanced by reaching a certain number of lines, and advancing quickly simply means getting lines completed rapidly.  Learning this takes some practice, and in particular you need to learn some non-intuitive drops.  Here are some examples:\n\n(x) = block part completes line and will clear\n(-) = block part is left\n\nx x x\n  -\n\nx x\n  -\n  -\n\nx x x\n-\n\nThese types of drops are harder to get used to because you brain thinks they will trap &quot;holes&quot; in your board.

If the stem is slanted, it won't uptake water at a constant pace, but instead at a variable rate which makes the tree more suceptiable to disease and lack of nutrition.\n\nIf the tree is already dry, the only thing you can do is try to mist the trunk from base to tip with water, and make sure enough potting soil and water is available at the base.  As the tree has no roots to go off of, you have to ensure proper wattering.\n\nAside from that, there isn't much else you can do.  Remember, that by having a  LIVE christmas tree, you are working on borrowed time.  Once the tree is cut down for decoration the tree starts to die.  There is no bringing it back to life, only maintaing it.","keep it watered.","I knew I was &quot;in love&quot; when I realized that I would do whatever was best for her, even if it completely broke my heart.\n\nUnfortunately, love is a huge risk.

Continue on with the same bedtime routines, dinner times, etc. wherever possible.\n\nLet your child know beyond the shadow of a doubt that *none* of this is *their* fault! Too many children tend to shoulder the blame for their parents' divorce, and they need to know that it is *not* their fault. Remind them of this often.\n\nTry to keep the contact that the child has with the other parent as open and viable as possible. If they want to call their parent, let them! If they want to spend an extra night with the other parent, let them! This shows them that you are not trying to alienate them from someone that they love. Let them talk about their other parent, and encourage their relationship.\n\nI truly believe that counseling is very helpful for children as well. There are even groups out there where they can meet other children of divorce, and this helps keep them from feeling so alone.\n\nAllow them to have their friends over, even if it is &quot;your&quot; parenting time. Again, this helps them to feel a sense of normalcy, even through such a hard time.\n\nLastly, always let them know how very precious they are to you. Children understand more than adults give them credit for, and letting them know that even while you and your spouse may not be &quot;in love&quot; anymore, does not mean that your love for your children has lessened in any way.

In other words, if you think you will only go in there & get what you want & nothing else, then you aren't being dominant, you are being selfish...a very fine line.

Though I knew that one of the reasons I'd wanted to marry him was because I was tired of living my life alone, I did think that I loved him. It took me about two &amp; a half years to finally realize that I had settled for something that was not at all what I really wanted or needed. It is a very hard thing to realize that you have made such a fatal error &amp; that you were really never truly in love with your spouse. For me, it brought home the fact that I really didn't know what love was or how to let someone love me. Problem for my first husband was that I realized that he wasn't the one that I wanted to love me. The whole thing led to a rather difficult divorce, from an emotional standpoint because he did, truly love me &amp; just couldn't understand why the feelings weren't returned.\n\nThe reason for telling you all of this is to possibly help highlight how you feel in your own relationship.

Also, if your life isn't turning out as you'd thought it would, there is a part that you play in that scenario. There are many, many things that you can do to change your life's course while still remaining married to your husband; being dissatisfied with what's going on in your life is probably more common than either you or myself realize. As for missing out on things, some of this might be attributed to the massive changes in your life...getting married, having a child. Everyone misses out on some of the things they'd thought they would do in life so, trust me, you're certainly not alone. Even so, if you consider what you might have missed out on, maybe you can find a way to do some of those things (like college or working outside the home, for instance).\n\nFinally, I must comment on your husband's past as it mirrors my second (current &amp; last...hahaha) husband's. There's something to be said for not having had any other relationships in the past in that you have no baggage. The biggest challenge is the &quot;what might have beens&quot; or the feeling that he may have of not experiencing enough of relationships himself. When it comes down to it, you may find that both you &amp; he have some similar thoughts on what you've missed out on by choosing to be together &amp; raise your child. Just a suggestion on my part here, but I'd talk to him about all of this if, in fact, you do love him. There is even a balance to be found in going out to do your own thing (respectably, of course) without him in tow...everyone needs their personal time away from the demands of their life.

You can be a wife and a mother and still be connected to yourself. The reason you feel the way you do is because you have no time for yourself and if you do you feel guilty for it. Most woman go through this especially if she's a stay at home mom. Men also go through this too. I would not suggest you giving your man up or family. If you are thinking that way then you need to ask yourself is it worth losing your family over? Try to find some time for yourself. Do something you like to do that isn't going to ruin your family. If you start feeling guilty for it just think of it this way you are helping your family out. After all if you are not happy then they will pick up on this and you will eventually start showing it towards them and even resenting them. You will blame them for you feeling like your life is gone. In other words you taking time out for yourself will help your family. You will feel better and they in turn will too.

Music that there is just one category for \"classic music\". As far as we have music from at least XV century till now there, this classification doesn't mean so much as even the styles are very different there.","You group like with like.  Easy, eh?  Now how you do that is where the talent comes in.  Record stores like to do it by the person performing the music.  That fails when the person decides to play something in a different style than they usually do (e.g., Paul McCartney).  \n\nSo, the only good way to do this, that won't fail or change over time, is to group music by it's own internal characteristics ... just as we group biological organisms by their DNA.  The many, many characteristics of even one bit of music make this a tough task.  Do you group all music in 3\/4 time together?  No.  All music without words?  All music with drums?  All music in an A-B-A form, all music in D major???  See how hard it is!\n\nAnother way that doesn't work well, but that people try  to use is to group music by time period.  Music from the 1950s, 1700s, 1990s, etc.  Just look around at the awesome variety of types of music being created today, and you'll realize that this classification scheme won't work either.\n\nSo, in the end, the best method is to use the music's own characteristics, but in more than one dimension.  That is, where you may have more than one bit of music in 3\/4, you need to also look at their harmony, instrumentation, form, rhythms, scale, melody, words (if any) and so on.  Music where all of those things are similar should be grouped together... and maybe, if there are enough, they could constitute a \"genre.\"\n\nGood luck!","downloads it","Maybe this will help...:)","Wikipedia says, &quot;the character was named after a stuffed bear owned by Milne's son, Christopher Robin Milne.&quot;\n\nHowever, a much more involved history (second link) says that he was named after a black bear cub from Winnipeg kept at the London Zoological Gardens.","Wikipedia says, \"the character was named after a stuffed bear owned by Milne's son, Christopher Robin Milne.\"\n\nHowever, a much more involved history (second link) says that he was named after a black bear cub from Winnipeg kept at the London Zoological Gardens.","In the very first strip, Hobbes is caught by Calvin in a tiger trap that is baited with a Tuna fish sandwich.

Movies are the same way.

If possible, try to get on with a union voucher...if you get three you are eligible for membership in the S.A.G.","I'll will make you a star when i become a Hollywood director :)","Where are you based? I'm assuming on the West Coast of the USA. If so and you really want to be a movie extra (not a principal actor) then you need to move to LA or to Canada where a lot of the provinces have ever-increasing movie business (and, therefore, ever-increasing support industries such as movie extras). Also, (by the way) most people prefer the term 'background', rather than 'extra'.\nIf you're coming to LA then there are many many background agencies who may take you on. Central casting is the biggest and casts probably 70-80% of all TV and movies. They have thousands of people working every day. Other agencies include Atmosphere, Extras Management, Vision & Networks (there are many others). These guys are what's known as 'call-in' services. For a small monthly fee they will hold pictures and your details on file along with your availability (you can let them know when you can and can't work) ready for the many productions companies who use these services to cast their projects. An example would be perhaps that a background Casting Director would call and ask for \"Caucasian females, in their 20's, who are between 120 and 140lbs and between 5'1\" and 5'5\"\" The call-in service would then send them all of the available clients on their books fitting their description. The CD then chooses from the list, books whomever he wants and the service calls you and confirms the day(s) of work. The call-in service also checks out whether or not the project is legit, thereby protecting you to a large degree.\nThat's one way of doing it.\nAnother service is probably LA's biggest online background database called hollywoodos.com. Check it out for info. It's basically the same as the call-in service but registered CDs can search the DB and you have to take the calls from any interested parties, check them out to see if they're legitimate and manage your calendar yourself.\nAn awful lot of people have cars that 'work' movies a lot, especially period cars from the 70s & 80s - that's another method of becoming an extra. Don't buy a white or red car - they never work as the light they produce screws up the cameras! Black and blue don't work as much either. I know a bunch of people whose cars work but they're never seen!\nAnother thing to consider is whether you going to do this for a living or just as a hobby. If you 'go' union (i.e. join SAG, the Screen Actors Guild, more info at sag.org), you can make at least $128 for 8 hours on set. This increases with overtime (if the day runs longer than 8 hours) and various other 'bumps' such as working in 'rain' or with smoke. If you resemble someone famous either facially or body-type (weight, height, hair, etc) you could try and work as a 'stand-in' (for a higher wage) to help crew setup shots and lighting whilst the 'stars' are off set.\nIf you are not a SAG member (and let's face it, you probably won't be when you first come to LA), you'll have to work non-union. The money is not great. Currently, it's around $54 for 8 hours on set. But there is free food (on most sets, sometimes it's just donuts and coffee) and when you're not working you're basically being paid to chat with the other background or sit down and read your book waiting for the next shot. It's not a great way to earn money as your earning potential doing pretty much anything else is going to be be higher than the hourly wage as a non-union extra. That said, I've seen non-union background become 'featured' often with a line or two which, on a SAG movie, can equal instant membership and much more money! It doesn't happen too often, but it does happen.\nThere is even unpaid background work which comes under the promise of 'copy, credit, meals'. This basically means that if you turn up on set and do what you're told, you be ","first assess your self in you have the talent and if you do, go to audition or places like studio, you might be in luck and be selected to be part of a movie or cast","HI! my sis is a movie extra for her \" vw beetle \" her email is dotcombabe@gmail.com ask her nicely but make sure to tell her her brother kevin told you to ask her just so she knows your not spam.\n\nMake the subject something like \" Kevin your bro told me to \" or something like that. \n\nhope this helps her vw is famous on a pretty cool movie .\n\ncheers, Kevin","If your really interested, I can put you in touch with someone who might give you an extra role in a movie.","There are agencies in L.A. that allow anyone to register with them for a fee and they supply movie extras to studios.

The battery is glued to the iPod so you may need to force the old one out.\n\nI would recommend using a 3rd party service to change the battery.","A battery that can be recharged doesn't need to be replaced, so perhaps you aren't asking the question you really want the answer for?  Lithium Ion batteries such as are in iPods need a full initial charge and then can be charged hundreds of times before needing replacement.  If you got a new iPod and it isn't holding a charge, its probably because you aren't charging it enough to begin with.\n\nIn order to charge an iPod's battery, you need to hook it up to a high-power (supplies 500mV) USB 2.0 port.  USB 1.1 ports don't supply enough power.  USB 2.0 ports usually will only supply enough power for one device at a time, so if you have a multi-port USB 2.0 hub, disconnect everything when you are charging your iPod.  Check with the documentation for your specific USB port - and make sure it says \"High power\".\n\nIf you are using USB 1.1, or do not have a high powered USB 2.0 port, you can get a charger from Belkin or other vendors which uses a transformer and a USB plug to charge your iPod.  There are different adapters for different iPods (I had to look hard for one that worked with my Shuffle) so make sure you get the one for your iPod.","How to edit message alert when in Portable Handsfree Profile \n\n \n \nPlease make sure that under the &quot;Message alert&quot; option you have not selected the &quot;No sound&quot; option.\nTo check this please follow these steps:\n\nIf you are already in Portable Handsfree Profile:\n1.

He is more likely \"addicted\" to the positive feeling he gets from smoking cannabis -- it is a euphorant, a mood elevator, and also is an anti-anxiety compound.  Regrettably both are short lived and require constant re-dosing which can leave a person in a run-down and lethargic state which can add to the depression they are experiencing.\n\nSelf-medicating with cannabis is common in schizophrenic and schizo-affective patients.  As a caregiver, please be sure he is eating a healthy diet and not junk food (there is some evidence that sugar, artificial sweeteners and flavorings, caffeine, and highly processed foods may also contribute to depression and anxiety.)\n\nAnd be sure to take care of yourself and the other members of your family.

Muscle burns calories even at rest, and the more of it you have, the higher your metabolic rate.  The composition of your diet is also important.  It takes calories to digest food.  Fats and Carbs do not take much energy to digest, but 15-30 % of the calories you get from protein are needed simply to digest the protein.  Only 3-4% of fat calories are needed to digest fat, and 10-15% of carb calories are needed to digest the carbs.\n\nAnother important point is that you should eat small meals, this will keep your metabolism up and your blood sugar stable.  Binge eating and then starving will cause you to put on fat with the binge; then lower your metabolism as you starve (and burn muscle in addtion to fat in the process).\n\nFiber will also reduce the absorption of food in the gut.  Calcium will also help with fat loss.  A study a number of years ago told some particiapnts to eat two cups of yogurt a day.  They could eat whatever else they wanted so long as they ate two cups of yogurt.  The participants lost weight with this method.","I asssume you mean a safe way to raise your metabolic rate, because I know of some ways that you might call natural that are deadly but will raise your metabolic rate in the short term.\n\nThe easiest way is to put on new muscle.

A lot of people can lose ten lbs like this.  The next thing to look at is alcohol consumption.  Alcohol has calories, lots of calories, that is where most of the alcohol in some beers comes from.  A shot of liquor with 0 carbs can have 70 calories.\n\nOnce you have done this, try to get the rest of your diet under control.  The most important point to remember is that the biochemical processes your body uses to put fat on or burn it away are regulated by your blood sugar.  \n\nIn response to high blood sugar the pancreas releases insulin, which promotes fat storage and inhibts fat burning.  When your blood sugar is low, glucagon is released which promotes fat burning rather than storage.  This is the theoretical basis for low carb diets, which are generally shown to be effective in the short term, i.e. a few months, maybe a year.  \n\nKetosis will occur, and this is not bad; it is your body's natural response to such a diet, a diet our prehistoric ancestors may have had all winter long. A ketogenic diet was developed years ago by one of the big name medical schools (Johns Hopkins I think, but don't quote me on this) for the control of seizures (seizures are not related to weight loss, but I am trying to say that it is not a random fad that is foreign to medicine.)\n\nYou do not have to go low carb to lose weight, but keep your meals small.  Spiking your blood sugar will cause your body to release excess insulin and pile on the pounds.\n\nBuilding muscle will also help your body to burn more calories at rest.  Running a mile each day may help some, but one study that monitored participants 24 hrs per day concluded that a little aerobic excercise once a day does not impact obesity that much; lifestyle does.  \n\nThat being said, a little aerobic excercise may help with blood pressure and lipid profile, so don't not excercise, just don't count on it for weight loss, unless you are building muscle, which will cause your body to burn more calories 24 hrs \/ day, even in bed.\n\nCaffeine will also help with weight loss.  Glucagon, which I mentioned earlier works by addinng phosphate groups to some enzymes that promote fat burning.  There is another enzyme located in cells called phosphodiesterase that removes these phosphate groups.  Caffeine inhibits phosphodiesterase, thereby enhancing the activity of glucagon.  This will make little difference if your body does not release Glucagon, though.\n\nOne more important thing to do is get enough calcium.  Calcium also promotes weight loss.  I provide an interesting study about this at the bottom.  The study is complicated, so read the whole thing.\n\nFiber also helps you feel full.  Eat whole grain breads, which will not cause you blood sugar to spike as much and will privde fiber.  Fiber also reduces absorption in the intestines a small amount, so you may crap out some extra calories.\n\nProtein takes a lot of energy simply to digest and may help you fel more satisfied.  Also eat slowly so that you have time to feel satisfied, especially if you have not eaten for a while.  If you eat fast, you may feel unsatisfied, keep stuffing yourself and then feel like a beached whale.\n\nFinally, like a previous poster said, sleep is also important.  Your body releases growth hormone in sleep, which helps with weight loss.  Also do not eat a bigmeal before bed, this will cause your body to release insulin instead of growth hormone.\n\nTo summarize:\n-NO high sugar drinks, diet drinks instead\n-Get Enough calcium\n-Eat small meals, and give yourself some time to feel full.  If you have to eat fast, that is fine, but rember it may take a little while for you to feel satisfied.\n-Try to eat foods with low to moderate amounts of carbohydrates (i.e. it's ok to eat bread on your sandwich, but substitute somethin for the potato chips), and where possible substitute whole grain for simple carbs","The first step is to cut sugar drinks out or your diet.

After he's gotten used to its existence, put it on him but without fastening it. As soon as he rebels and tries to get out of it, take it off. This will show him that you're not forcing him to wear it. Do this once or twice a day for 3 or 4 days.\n3. Now that he's more comfortable with the harness, fasten it on him for no more than 5 minutes at a time. Again, do this once or twice a day for 3 or 4 days.\n4. Now that he's used to wearing it, let him wear it around the house for 15 to 20 minutes, or take it off sooner if he tries to get out of it. Again for 3 or 4 days.\n5.

Even the gentlest ferret shampoos strip their skin and fur of the natural oils the skin makes to keep the hairs healthy.  While you might think this makes the muskiness better it actually makes it worse for a little while, their skin overcompensates by making more oil and therefore more of the scent that some people find offensive.  I never bathed my guys more than once every 2-3 months - unless they got into something stinky or dirty (watch out for potted plants!!!) and they smelled fine!

While you might think this makes the muskiness better it actually makes it worse for a little while, their skin overcompensates by making more oil and therefore more of the scent that some people find offensive.  I never bathed my guys more than once every 2-3 months - unless they got into something stinky or dirty (watch out for potted plants!!!) and they smelled fine!  You might feel the need to do it more or less often, depending on your (or your roommate's or parents') tolerance for the odor, which some people (like me) don't particularly mind.\n\nBut when you do give them a bath, let 'em play in the sink\/tub until they get bored of, it if they want to.

The result of not treating it swiftly can be deafness for the cat.\n\nI got my cat from a friend of a friend who owned a farm.  She was born there and probably spent a lot of time in the barn and outdoors in general. When I got her she had this black gunk in both her ears.\n\nI took her to the vet almost as soon as I got her, so I could get her shots and get her registered, checked out, and her checked out and find out anything I should know as a cat owner.  She was the first cat I had ever owned.\n\nHe said the black stuff was ear mites and gave me some stuff for that.  I dutifully put that on her on my back patio in the mornings according to the directions that came with it.  The result was her ears got clean and stayed that way forever.  She suffered no loss of hearing as far as I can tell.  She comes when I call her name, just like a dog, in fact!\n\nMy mom had a cat which she got from a shelter.  Eventually it passed on to my brother.  Before, it had been an indoor cat.  My brother decided it should be an outdoor cat.  At some point, the cat must have gotten ear mites.  Not sure if this was before anyone in our family had it or afterwards.  Whichever it was, the mite infestation must not have been caught and treated in time.  \n\nThe cat is quite deaf.  It never responds when being called, even to look, when you are right there in the room with it.  It does not respond to loud noises at all, either.\n\nI know the annual checkups you take your cat to the vet for are kind of expensive but a big portion of that is for the shots, some of which they do not need every year anyway.  For example, my cat gets a 3 year rabies shot - so it does not need one every year.  So most years, the annual visit to vet is not as expensive as that one.\n\nIf you are sure that the condition is caused by ear mites and you cannot afford to take the cat to the vet right now, at least get the medicine right away and apply it as directed.  I just looked, and PetSmart carries it.  There is probably a PetSmart near you and if not, it looks like you can order it from their web site.  It only costs $10.49 today.\n\nAccording to the second Source I have listed (kittencare.com) the mites could have moved from your cat to your house.  It sounds like they might move back again.  You might want to be on guard for that.\n\nI really encourage you to talk to a vet.\n\nLike I said, though both my cat and my brother's\/mother's cat had the same condition - my cat has perfect hearing and the other cat is completely deaf.  The only difference was in the treatment they received.\n\nIf you must skip the visit to the vet, or delay it, do not delay treating the ear mites at all!  Get the medicine for it and carefully use it as directed.\n\nMake sure you apply the miticide outside and make sure you dispose of whatever you apply it to your cats ears with outside as well.  Do not bring it back in your house to throw it away.  Do not wipe your cats ears inside. You might wipe the mites onto your floor and you really want to keep them outside.\n\nI am including a couple more links just so you will have more sources of information at your fingertips.  Might as well do all your research at once so you can act right away, without second thoughts or wishing you had more information.\n\nGood luck with the treatment and I hope your kitty gets well!\n\nThe first step is spotting the mites and recognizing what they are, not just thinking it is dirt.\n\nYou have done that, so now all that is left is the treatment and it is not hard to do.\n\nMake sure you hold your cat's head perfectly still while you apply the stuff.  Do not go in too far, either.\n\nShe should be fine if you have caught the problem in time.","You could start with a simple ear cleaning--use warm olive\/cooking oil.

If the cat continues to spray, consult an animal behaviorist and your veterinarian. Some cats need temporary antianxiety medication.","There can be several reasons behind this. First, take the cat to the vet to ascertain it is not ill. (Cats will urinate in odd places when they are not well.) Then, examine the litter box area. Is it clean and in a comfortable space? Is the litter too scented? Cats have a very keen sense of smell, and do not like a lot of perfume. Does the litter pan have a cover? Some cats do not like the covers, and will rebel against it. If these suggestions do not help, have your carpets professionally cleaned and deodarized. Reward your cat when he does use the litter box, to re-enforce good behavior. Do NOT spray water (or any liquid) in your cat's face. This constitutes abuse.","you can train a cat by using a water spray bottle.  Everytime your cat does something wrong (like urinating on the carpet), spray the water in their face.  It has been known to work and it probably the most uncruel way of training you cat.","One of the best ways to prevent a cat from urinating in unwanted places is to provide the cat with a place where it feels comfortable urinating. This means that you must clean the litter-box regularly. No cat wants to pee in filth. If the only options are a dirty box and the closet, it will often opt for the closet.\n\nIf this is not the issue, see the vet to make sure that there is not an underlying physical problem.","Well, i beleive electronic collars are torturess and inhumane.

For example, any dog in the 'hound' family is going to bark - it's just hard-wired into their DNA. Also, a dog that has been behaving in such a manner for most of its' life is probably not going to change its ways now.  All dogs, though, want to please it's master (Alpha Male\/Female, whatever you like); positive reinforcement when the dog acts appropriately and negative reinforcement when it acts up, consistently applied, should get you some results.  Give the dog a special treat when it accepts its meals without barking!","get a \"no bark\" electronic collar.  when the dog barks, the collar delivers a small electronic shock, the more they bark the stronger the shock gets.","Don't bathe your pet too often!

Or is he getting into the box successfully, only to miss after he's in the process of going?  I would suggest buying a litterbox with a cover, because that would insure that anything not 'aimed' into the box would still get in there.  Take note, however, you might want to clean the top of the litterbox often, because although the smell might not end up on your floor, it will still be there.  Good luck!

Show it in full color, grey scale, white on black, black on white, and on colors, even in diff uses. \n\nCreate rules on how it can be used and make a style sheet with those examples (17 x 11). Show what is allowed and what is not allowed. Call out Pantone colors.\n\nDetermine a colorscheme if appropriate, and put the colors there as well. Often fonts will be used, add the font names (and which vendor the font can be found) on the style sheet too.\n\nSupply the font printed out,and digitally in vector and bitmap variateions.\n\nWhen designing a logo think about how many objects you want to manage. You can do them, but when you hand it off to, say a newspaper ad, they may impliment them in a poor way. \n\nOne way to reduce this problem is have the text be stylized so as to become the logo. Managing one piece is often better than more. Nike shows the swoosh, but they have invested so we know the typed address Nike. \n\nA new brand is not known untill it exists in the mind of the consumer, so a new &quot;mark&quot; is not enough to find the buisness.\n\nUsing NIKE.com can be an effective logo since it is an identity and an address.\n\nAlso think of the branding parts like a tumbler in a lock. The more you develop the same look, name, way, the easier it is to  get brand recogdnition. The logo must integrate with a comprehesinve branding style for peak effectivenes.\n\nLastly, look at what conveys the message over 20 years, avoid  trendy images. The swoosh was in vogue untill the .com crash and then the logo was the main problem for the company since investors could instantly recognize a .com company by the swoosh. \n\nThat's it\nGood Luck","Logos convey a unique indentity.\n\nDepending on how literal or stylistic depends on the taste of your client.

If your lucky you have a good client (1 in 10 are design literate)\n\nThe uses of the logo must be recognizable at very small and clean at very large sizes. make it as small as it can go and enlarge at 125% steps to make sure you are on the mark.\n\nAlso since this is the identity, it is the cornerstone of branding. Show it in full color, grey scale, white on black, black on white, and on colors, even in diff uses. \n\nCreate rules on how it can be used and make a style sheet with those examples (17 x 11). Show what is allowed and what is not allowed. Call out Pantone colors.\n\nDetermine a colorscheme if appropriate, and put the colors there as well. Often fonts will be used, add the font names (and which vendor the font can be found) on the style sheet too.\n\nSupply the font printed out,and digitally in vector and bitmap variateions.\n\nWhen designing a logo think about how many objects you want to manage. You can do them, but when you hand it off to, say a newspaper ad, they may impliment them in a poor way. \n\nOne way to reduce this problem is have the text be stylized so as to become the logo. Managing one piece is often better than more. Nike shows the swoosh, but they have invested so we know the typed address Nike. \n\nA new brand is not known untill it exists in the mind of the consumer, so a new \"mark\" is not enough to find the buisness.\n\nUsing NIKE.com can be an effective logo since it is an identity and an address.\n\nAlso think of the branding parts like a tumbler in a lock. The more you develop the same look, name, way, the easier it is to  get brand recogdnition. The logo must integrate with a comprehesinve branding style for peak effectivenes.\n\nLastly, look at what conveys the message over 20 years, avoid  trendy images. The swoosh was in vogue untill the .com crash and then the logo was the main problem for the company since investors could instantly recognize a .com company by the swoosh. \n\nThat's it\nGood Luck","hire a graphic designer :D","I'm assuming that you need to design a logo for your client.\n\n1. Find out what the business does. What sector, what industry, etc.\n2. Find out the client's favorites - colors, websites, logos, other design preferences - will help you in generating ideas that are not too far away from what the client expects.\n3. Keep in mind some basic logo design guidelines like - where will the logo be used - if on web only then you can try 3D and gradients galore and multi-colors. If it has to be used for print and also depending on the client's print cost restrictions, you might have to create two color logos. Keep the logo simple unless the client is looking for an \"illustrated\" logo where you could do detailed drawings.\n4. It's best to start with line drawings and sketches for the logo shape - based in client feedback then you can fill in color and finish off the logo as a finalized EPS\/Vector file and deliver it to the client in CMYK as well as RGB color formats.\n\nOne thing to do is surf the internet to take a look at some of the best logos - you'll notice that most are very simple, using only one symbol or text - like the Nike logo.","On 22 February 1987, Andy Warhol died following complications from gall bladder surgery at the age of 58.","On 22 February 1987, Andy Warhol died following complications from gall bladder surgery at the age of 58.","complications from gallbladder surgery","Approaching an issue head on and with strong determination is the only way to deal with any issue that taxes on the human body so extremely, espically as described by the poster above.\n\nIf the issue is so extreme that everything has to be given, with the extend of the life, then approaching it from ONE SOLID point of view is what is best.\n\nI reccomend doing thought provoked research on the subject, finding out as much as you possibly can about the issue, and then make your choices accordingly.
