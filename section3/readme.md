# RateAState.online
## A friendly competition

### Technologies
d3.js- drawing the map
p5.js- tag cloud for each state
CodeIgniter PHP framework with MySQL database- data persistence

### Why?
With all the buzz over the recent midterm elections, I thought this would be a fun exercise in poll design and "election" result visualization. 

### Questions raised
While I initially thought about this as just a fun little thing, it made me think a lot about the choices made by poll designers and data visualizers. How am I unconsciuously introducing bias? What are the implications of the map projections, scales, and color schemes I've picked? Is it problematic to even create this "competition"? Is it amplifying tribalism in the United States? How does starting each state with a 5/10 rating rather than a 0/10 or 10/10 affect things
